Kashmir offers two different experiences, one during the summers when the whole valley looks enthralling with its lush-green landscape and snow-capped mountains in the backdrop and other during the winter season when it is all covered with white snow. No matter when you plan a visit to this place, it will always offer you a blissful experience. It is known as the heaven on the Earth for a reason as it is a postcard-card perfect scenery drawn by nature.",
